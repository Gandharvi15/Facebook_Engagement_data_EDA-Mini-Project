📊 Facebook Engagement Data EDA Mini Project.


📘 Overview

This project explores Facebook user engagement data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in user activity, demographics, and engagement metrics.
It provides insights into how factors like age, account type, country, and verification status influence engagement levels.


🎯 Objectives

Identify outliers and clean inconsistent data (age, country, account type).

Explore relationships between engagement metrics — likes, comments, shares, posts.

Compare engagement between verified vs. non-verified users.
